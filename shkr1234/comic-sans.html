			<p class="content-title">Rough Beginings</p>
			<p class="content-text">Origionally designed by Vincent Connare, its intended use wase to act as a speech bubble for MS Bob (one of the helper characters for Windows 95). However, 
									Connare was unable to make this deadline. As a result, Comic Sans was not used with MS Bob but insetead later shipped with Windows 95 Plus. Due to the font
									not releasing on time, it was caught between the raster and aliased era. Now Comic Sans was created as a rater font, it was meant to be made of blocky pixels,
									instead Comic Sans was released as an aliased font, replacing its chunky pixels with smooth lines.</p>
			
			<p class="content-title">Unaccounted Changes</p>
			<p class="content-text">Vincent Connare was not ready for the change to a aliased font. His font was designed to be a raster font. It was switched without his permission by people
									who saw what aliasing regular fonts did. Alisaing regular fonts made them much mare appealing with elgeant curves and straight lines. But Comic Sans <b>wasn't</b>
									most fonts. The curves of Comic Sans were sloppy not elegant and its lines wern't staright, these things don't transfer well to aliased fonts. Comic Sans wen't from
									a decent font to a bad one and things were about to get much worse.</p>
									
			<p class="content-title">The Plague of Overuse</p>
			<p class="content-text">A problem soon arose for Connare and Comic Sans. The aliased version had shipped with Windows 95, the most popular Operating system to date and with the takeoff of the 
									personal printer, everyone and anyone could make flyers in a few clicks (and some key presses). Now people soon discoverd that they could change the look of their text
									by selecting different options under the 'Font' drop-down menu. What font did this amatuer designers go for? Why the whimsical Comic Sans of course. It was a decent enough
									font to be posted on every telephone pole in a neighboor hood. However this poplularity lead to Comic Sans being overused. It could be seen everywhere at your school, your
									work, you home and even on your computer. soon people grew sick of this font, it was used everywhere but wasn't good enough to be used everywhere. This is what lead to the
									emmense backlash towards Comic Sans, it wasn't good enough for them.</p>
